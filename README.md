# Firebase Image Uploader ðŸ”¥

To use, create a Firebase project and copy the config into a file in the 'firebase' folder called `config.js`
Then, on Firebase, make sure you have 'Firestore Database' and 'Storage' enabled.

Todo:

Add modal
Add login/signup functionality so each individual can upload their own images

Ignore the slow image loading, my internet sucks...
